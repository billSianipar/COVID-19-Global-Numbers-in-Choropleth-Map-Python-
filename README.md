# COVID-19 Cases Worldwide Using Choropleth (Python)

`As SARS-CoV-2 (widely known as Coronavirus) has spreaded globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this phenomenon as global pandemic.
In US alone (at the time this notebook was created) the death toll already reached 20,000 people.`

`This notebook was created not only to share to the world of how we can use python and plotly to generate the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases and death cases caused by coronavirus, but also to make people become more aware of how massive and fast the spread of this virus.`

`Hopefully this notebook can serve its two purposes. And the pandemic can be over very soon.`
